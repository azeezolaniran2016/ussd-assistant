These are:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Enable Notification: Enable this option to allow a notification \n          to be displayed whenever the app is inactive. This is for easy \n          access to the app.\n        </li>\n        <li>Remeber Network: Enable this option if you are using a dual sim phone. It enables the app to\n            start from the last selected network\n            . It is recommended that you disable this option if you aren't using a dual sim phone.\n        </li>\n        <li>Remeber Last Inputs: Enable this option if you want certain inputs in various input dialogs\n            in the app to be remebered next time you\n            launch them. It is recommended to keep this option checked.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p className=\"warning\"> Please note: On dual sim phones you are expected to select the right network\n          provider in the \"select sim prompt\" which pops up whenever you try to launch an action.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HelpPage;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./client/components/help/HelpPage.js","import React from 'react';\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"jumbotron\">\n      <h1>USSD Assistant </h1>\n      <p className=\"lead\">\n        Welcome to USSD Assistant.
